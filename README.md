# The jankest .TTF font parser and renderer in town
**Please do not use this in production**. This project only implements the bare minimum of the OTF spec to support very basic font parsing and rendering. It has been tested mainly on the Ubuntu fontface (`ubuntu.ttf`) and no guarantees are made that it will render other fonts correctly. 

On a lighter note, this project has no dependencies and can be easily adapted to run on any system.
